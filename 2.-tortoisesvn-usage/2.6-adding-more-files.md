# 2.6 Adding More Files

As the project develops you will need to add new files - let's say you add some new features in Extras.c and add a reference in the existing Makefile. Right click on the folder and TortoiseSVN → Add. The Add dialog now shows you all unversioned files and you can select which ones you want to add. Another way of adding files would be to right click on the file itself and select TortoiseSVN → Add.

Now when you go to commit the folder, the new file shows up as Added and the existing file as Modified. Note that you can double click on the modified file to check exactly what changes were made.
