# 2.8 Undoing Changes

One feature of all revision control systems is that they let you undo changes that you made previously. As you would expect, TortoiseSVN makes this easy to access.

If you want to get rid of changes that you have not yet committed and reset your file to the way it was before you started editing, TortoiseSVN → Revert is your friend. This discards your changes \(to the Recycle bin, just in case\) and reverts to the committed version you started with. If you want to get rid of just some of the changes, you can use TortoiseMerge to view the differences and selectively revert changed lines.

If you want to undo the effects of a particular revision, start with the Log dialog and find the offending revision. Select Context Menu → Revert changes from this revision and those changes will be undone.
