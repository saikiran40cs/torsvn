# 1.1 System requirements

TortoiseSVN runs on Windows 7 or higher and is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavours. The installer for 64-bit Windows also includes the 32-bit extension parts. Which means you don't need to install the 32-bit version separately to get the TortoiseSVN context menu and overlays in 32-bit applications.

Support for Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows NT4 was dropped in version 1.2.0, and Windows 2000 and XP up to SP2 support was dropped in 1.7.0. Support for Windows XP with SP3 was dropped in 1.9.0. You can still download and install older versions if we need them.
